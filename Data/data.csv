Instead of fragmenting security between modules, EigenLayer aggregates ETH security across all of them. This increases the security of the decentralized applications (DApps) that rely on the modules. In addition, holders of Ether can pursue additional value through the new fee-generating opportunities from these manifold modules. EigenLayer also acts as a staging system for Ethereum, where new innovations such as Danksharding and proposer/builder separation can be battle-tested in manifold variations before the best ideas can be integrated back into Ethereum.
