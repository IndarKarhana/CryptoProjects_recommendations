# Crypto Venture Scout

This repository contains Python code for matching textual descriptions with existing data using word embeddings and numerical features. The matching process involves training a Word2Vec model on textual descriptions, creating embeddings for textual data, combining embeddings with numerical features, reducing dimensionality using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and matching new data with existing data based on similarity.
